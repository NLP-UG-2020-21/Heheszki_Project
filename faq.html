                <div class="content">
                <p>IPA, abbreviation for International Phonetic Alphabet, is an alphabetic system of phonetic notation. Devised by the International Phonetic Association in the late 19th century as a standardized representation of speech sounds in written form. To learn more,

                <button type="button" class="collapsible">What is X-SAMPA?</button>
                <div class="content">
                <p>X-SAMPA stands for Extended Speech Assessment Methods Phonetic Alphabet. It is a variant of SAMPA developed in 1995 by John C. Wells. Why is it designed, you may ask. It is designed to unify the individual language SAMPA alphabets, and extend SAMPA to cover the entire 
                    range of characters in the 1993 version of International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). The result is a SAMPA-inspired remapping of the IPA into 7-bit ASCII.</p>
                </div>
                <button type="button" class="collapsible">What is TIPA?</button>
                <div class="content">
                <p>It is a free software package providing International Phonetic Alphabet and other phonetic character capabilities for TeX and LaTeX. In 2018, the TeX TIPA Roman font was selected as best representing the IPA symbol set by the International Phonetic Association's Alphabet, Charts and Fonts committee.
                    <br>
                    <br>TIPA characters are placed within a LaTeX document using any of the following ways: \textipa{...}, {\tipaencoding ...}, or \begin{IPA} ... \end{IPA}.</br>
