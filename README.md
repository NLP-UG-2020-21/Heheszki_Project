### Heheszki_Project

## Hello! Welcome to our project!

<p>We are aiming to create an automatic software that is able to transcribe two languages: English and Polish, in that case. You can insert a text and you will have it transcribed. The software supports mainly *IPA* ([International Phonetic Alphabet] [1]). It is especially crucial and usefel for any language students, since phonetic alphabets could help you learn how to pronounce particular words.
